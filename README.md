# Aoc2023

[Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) Solutions, in Elixir!

All solutions are original work by me, [jgnagy](https://github.com/jgnagy), and are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

To run the solutions, you'll need to have Elixir installed. Then, clone this repo and run `mix deps.get` to install dependencies. Drop your input data into `data/` as `day1.txt`. You can then run the solutions with `mix aoc2024.day1` (replacing `day1` with the day you want to run for both the input data and the mix task). To run the doc tests (which work against the included sample data), run `mix test`.
